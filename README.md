# dotfiles

My Awesome Dotfiles are collected with the [yadm](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/) dotfile manager.

## Quick install on fresh environment

_**OSX or Ubuntu only.** Will automatically install homebrew or linuxbrew if not already installed._

```bash
curl -Lks https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kodeFant/98e6d05e42b8a4acedd6ea7aaae26794/raw | /bin/bash
```

## Manual install:

[Install yadm](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/), and clone this reopository:

```bash
yadm clone https://github.com/kodeFant/dotfiles.git
```

# Notes on Linux

- `FiraCode Nerd Fonts` needs to be installed manually from https://nerdfonts.com/ (.otf fonts are better that .ttf)
- Homebrew Casks does not work on linux (I will consider making and apt-script)

My Awesome Dotfiles made with [yadm](https://thelocehiliosan.github.io/yadm/).

##Quick install on fresh environment

_**OSX or Ubuntu only.** Will homebrew or linuxbrew if not already installed._

```bash
curl -Lks https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kodeFant/98e6d05e42b8a4acedd6ea7aaae26794/raw | /bin/bash
```

Manual install:

Install yadm, and clone it

```bash
yadm clone https://github.com/kodeFant/dotfiles.git

# On Linux

FiraCode NerdFonts needs to be installed manually from https://nerdfonts.com/

.otf fonts are better that .ttf
